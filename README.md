# tea-cozy

This is a fictional tea shop website. The purpose of this project was to recreate the tea shop given to us through a web page red outline.

It was used to practice flexbox, git branching, and how to size sections. On the way I learned how to do background images, <br> in paragraphs, and how to better organize some of my CSS code.
